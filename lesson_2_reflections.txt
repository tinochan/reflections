What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
.git folder will be created and the files inside the directory and subdirectories can be tracked later on.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It give you chances to think carefully if the later on commit will be a logically integrated one. You may roll back before you are ready.
